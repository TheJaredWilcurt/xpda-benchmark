# xpda-benchmark

A benchmark for launching NW.js and Electron.


## Notes about the benchmark process:

* NW.js actually loads more of the app before closing, where as Electron doesn't even attempt to do a paint of the page before closing, which gives Electron a slight advantage (basically has a head start on closing).
* Despite having like 30 badly named events that are all meant to convey when the page is "done", none of them actually tie to this, and the last one to fire is actually `console-message`, which still fires before the content is painted to the screen. Electron will be ever-annoying until the day it dies.
* I would have preferred to close the app from the Window in Electron, as that would be better for the benchmark, but Electron is "extremely limited" (aka, trash), so this is literally impossible with it.


## Results

**Lower is better.** Results use "Time Elapsed". It's interesting that sometimes Electron is just barely faster, and other times NW.js is more than twice as fast.

Based on the total times, **Electron is 21.66s slower** at launching/closing, across all platforms tested.


### Running the benchmark

1. Install [Node.js/npm](https://nodejs.org)
1. Download, fork, or clone this repo
1. Run `npm install`
1. Run `npm start`
   * The initial run may be slightly worse for both, because it will be creating folders/files in the AppData folder on first run of any NW.js or Electron app (or anything based on Chromium)
   * You can run this multiple times. Depending on system resources you will get slightly different results (generally +/-1 second) 
   * May need to change `.\\electron` to `./electon` on Linux in `package.json`
